# simple_flask_app
This is a simple as possible application using flask to service AJAX requests
that come from a simple website using html, css, javascript, jquery, and bootstrap.

This framework is meant to provide a jump start on python data science appdev when the app is serving a 
sklearn model to a front end UI (which is often?)
